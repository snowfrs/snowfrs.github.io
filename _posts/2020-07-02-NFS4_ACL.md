# Abstract
This shows you how to use the NFSv4 ACL permissions system. An ACL (access control list) is a list of permissions associated with a file or directory. These permissions allow you to restrict access to a certian file or directory by user or group. NFSv4 ACLs provide more specific options than typical POSIX read/write/execute permissions used in most systems.

# package
You need install package to use nfs4_acl

rpm package name is **nfs4-acl-tools**

# Understanding NFSv4 ACL

This is an example of an NFSv4 ACL
```txt
A::user@nfsdomain.org:rxtncy
```

The following sections will break down this example from left to right and provide more usage options

## ACE Type
The '**A**' in the example is known as the ACE (access control entry) type. The '**A**' denotes "Allow" meaning this ACL is allowing the user or group to perform actions requiring permissions. Anything that is not explicitly allowed is denied by default.

Note: '**D**' can denote a Deny ACE. While this is a valid option, this ACE type is not reccomended since any permission that is not explicity granted is automatically denied meaning Deny ACE's can be redundant and complicated.

## ACE Flags
The above example could have a distinction known as a flag shown below
```txt
A:d:user@nfsdomain.org:rxtncy
```

The '**d**' used above is called an inheritence flag. This makes it so the ACL set on this directory will be automatically established on any new subdirectories. Inheritence flags only work on directories and not files. Multiple inheritence flags can be used in combonation or omitted entirely. Examples of inheritence flags are listed below:

|Flag           |Name           |Function|
|:------:       |:-------:      |:--------:|
|d      | directory-inherit     | New subdirectories will have the same ACE|
|f      | file-inherit          | New files will have the same ACE minus the inheritence flags|
|n      | no-propogate inherit  | New subdirectories will inherit the ACE minus the inheritence flags|
|i      | inherit-only          | New files and subdirectories will have this ACE but the ACE for the directory with the flag is null|

# ACE Principal
the `'user@nfsdomain.org'` is a principal. The principal denotes the people the ACL is allowing access to.

Principals can be the following:

+ A named user `user1@nfsdomain.org`
+ Speical principals **OWNER@** **GROUP@** **EVERYONE@**
+ A group `A:g:group1@nfsdomain.org:rxtncy` When the principal is a group, you need to add a group flag, `'g'`, as shown above example.

# ACE Permissions
the `'rxtncy'` are the permissions the ACE is allowing. Permissions can be used in combonation with each other.

A list of permissions and what they do can be found below:

|Permission                 |Function
|:--------------------------|:-----------------------------|
|r  	                    |read-data (files) / list-directory (directories)|
|w	                        |write-data (files) / create-file (directories)|
|a	                        |append-data (files) / create-subdirectory (directories)|
|x	                        |execute (files) / change-directory (directories)|
|d	                        |delete the file/directory|
|D	                        |delete-child : remove a file or subdirectory from the given directory (directories only)|
|t	                        |read the attributes of the file/directory|
|T	                        |write the attribute of the file/directory|
|n	                        |read the named attributes of the file/directory|
|N	                        |write the named attributes of the file/directory|
|c	                        |read the file/directory ACL|
|C	                        |write the file/directory ACL|
|o	                        |change ownership of the file/directory|

Aliases such '`R`' '`W`' '`X`' can be used as permissions. These work simlarly to POSIX Read/Write/Execute. More detail can be found below.

|Alias	    |Name   	|Expansion|
|:----------|:----------|:--------|
|R	        |Read       |rntcy|
|W	        |Write	    |watTNcCy (with D added to directory ACE's|
|X	        |Execute	|xtcy|

## nfs4_getfacl

`nfs4_gefacl /path`

## nfs4_setfacl

### commands
Commands are only used when first setting an ACE. Commands and their uses are listed below.

|COMMAND	            |FUNCTION|
|:----------------------|:-------|
|-a acl_spec [index]	|add ACL entries in acl_spec at index (DEFAULT: 1)|
|-x acl_spec \| index	|remove ACL entries or entry-at-index from ACL|
|-A file [index]	    |read ACL entries to add from file|
|-X file	            |read ACL entries to remove from file|
|-s acl_spec	        |set ACL to acl_spec (replaces existing ACL)|
|-S file	            |read ACL entries to set from file|
|-m from_ace to_ace	    |modify in-place: replace 'from_ace' with 'to_ace'|

### Options
Options can be used in combination or ommitted entirely. A list of options is shown below:

|OPTION	        |NAME	        |FUNCTION|
|:--------------|:--------------|:--------|
|-R	            |recursive	    |Applies ACE to a directory's files and subdirectories|
|-L	            |logical	    |Used with -R, follows symbolic links|
|-P	            |physical	    |Used with -R, skips symbolic links|

# Use cases
```bash
nfs4_setfacl -Ra A::user1@domain:RWX  /path

nfs4_setfacl -a A:fdg:group1@domain:RWX  /path
```
